    <p class = "response">"It could be argued that it was the 18th century that the specifically American form of Christianity—undogmatic, moralistic rather than credal, tolerant but strong, and all-pervasive of society—was born, and that the Great Awakening was its midwife.: (109). What does Johnson mean he refers to the Great Awakening as a midwife?
        A midwife is usually a woman that helps care for mothers and babies during the stages leading up to birth and after. In this excerpt, Johnson refers to this spread of “undogmatic,” “moralistic,” and, “tolerant” essence of Christianity as a midwife because the Great Awakening fostered many new ideas surrounding religion and ideology in America. The “maturing” of this American Christianity was a direct effect of the Great Awakening's proponents. In short, none of the growth of these ideas would not have been ingrained into the American soul without the Great Awakening. Its proponents changed people's values in the early Americas.
     
    “Indeed to some extent it was a protest against the religious leadership of the well fed, self-righteous congregations of the long-established towns.” (110). What was Jonathan Edwards' impact on religion in America?  What was George Whitfield's impact on religion in America?
    Jonathan Edwards' was a significant force in changing religion in America because he was a Great Awakening preacher. He wrote an incredibly famous sermon called Sinners at the Hand of an Angry God. He gave a new, more positive perspective to the traditional harsh version of Christianity people were used to. He highlighted the idea that God was a positive, loving force and a “bounty to mankind”. He opposed the established Calivinist ideals and preached religious freedom. His main message was that “love is the essence of the religious experience.”  George Whitefiled also contributed to the Great Awakening, by continuing to have great success in spreading these New Light views. He toured around the U.S. and routinely drew massive crowds, and even influenced the Puritan hold out of Boston. The Baptists contributed and smaller Protestant sects gained much from his teaching as they moved forward.
     
    “The curious thing about the Great Awakening is that it moved, simultaneously, in two different directions which were in appearance contradictory.” (114). What does Johnson mean he claims the Great Awakening moved, simultaneously, in two directions? 
    Johnson, refers to the fact that America both grew closer with religion and Christianity and moved away from it. Many Americans started to move towards the concepts of agnosticism and atheism, while many others began to cultivate a deep emotional relationship with God.  This split made America more of a melting pot of peoples than it already was, and those who chose to delve deeper into Christianity created the “foundations of American religious liberalism. ” This movement towards rational ideas of freedom and creation of government, were backed up by religious morals. 
     
    “The Great Awakening was thus the proto-revolutionary event, the formative moment in American history, preceding the political drive for independence and making it possible.” What does Johnson mean when he says the Great Awakening was thus a proto-revolutionary event?
    Johnson calls the Great Awakening a proto-revolutionary event since it made American independence possible. It formed the feelings necessary for the American Revolution. More specifically, it helped unify the diverse American people within the context of religion. It created a uniquely American idea of religion, which contrasts the traditional importance of the clergy, among other things. In short,  though there was much religious diversity, the Great Awakening brought the diverse colonies together which helped spur American independence into a reality.
     
    What point is Johnson making in his closing paragraph about rationalism and religion?
    
        In his last paragraph, Johnson is tying the Great Awakening to the connection between Americans and the driving forces of the American Revolution. He states that instead of the rationalism of the wealthy upper class and the newly religious masses clashing, they actually worked together to point their politics toward the Revolution. Without the Great Awakening, the enlightened elites of America would've never joined the people to create a Revolution and the independent state that it produced.
